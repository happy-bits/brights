# Project - React

## What

Techniques: React

Make a **component** (the component may use other components)

The component should contain a couple of form elements such as
- date selector
- text box
- radio button
- checkbox
- button
- select box
- textarea
- color picker
- range

Pick one component from the **Ideas**-folder or choose your own.

(You can decide how you want the component to look and behave, don't have to copy an idea exactly)

## Select three

Select three candidates from Ideas (or choose your own)

The we meet and decide which of the three ideas you finally get.

## Shuffle

Script to randomize the groups to see which group that will pick first:

    ["Group 1","Group 2","Group 3","Group 4","Group 5","Group 6"].sort((a, b) => 0.5 - Math.random())

## Hint

Use Bootstrap so you don't need spend too much time with CSS.

## Presentation

Create a slide (powerpoint or similar).

Present your project in 10 minutes:
- Why did you choose to do this?
- Demonstrates how your component works
- What was challenging?
- What have you learned?
- Show one or two details from the code
