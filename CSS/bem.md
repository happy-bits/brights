# BEM

The Block, Element, Modifier methodology (commonly referred to as BEM) is a popular **naming convention** for classes in HTML and CSS. Developed by the team at Yandex, its goal is to help developers better understand the relationship between the HTML and CSS in a given project.

In this CSS methodology a **block** is a **top-level** abstraction of a new component, for example a button: .button { }. This block should be thought of as a parent. **Child** items, or **elements**, can be placed inside and these are denoted by two underscores following the name of the block like .button__price { }. Finally, **modifiers** can manipulate the block so that we can **theme** or style that particular component without inflicting changes on a completely unrelated module. 

Another smart part of BEM is that everything is a class and **nothing is nested**. That makes CSS specificity very flat and low, which is a good idea. It means you wonâ€™t end up fighting with yourself over specificity.
