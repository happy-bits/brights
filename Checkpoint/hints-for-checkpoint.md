# Hints for checkpoint

## General

On the checkpoint you'll get a HTML-file, a CSS file and an (almost) empty JavaScript file. You'll do all your work in the JavaScript-file. 

You only need to solve Level 1 to pass the checkpoint.

## Level 1

Solve the JavaScript part for these exercises again:
- Lab01 
- Lab02
- Lab03
- Lab04
- Email

## Level 2

First study for Level 1

Then look at the solution for **Region**. Try to solve the exercise yourself (the Javascript-part)
